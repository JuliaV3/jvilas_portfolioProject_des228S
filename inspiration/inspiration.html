    <h1>Andy Warhol</h1>

    <p>Andy Warhol is a designer I admire because of how bold and ahead of his time he was.</p>
    <p>His work didn't just make a statement—it changed the way people saw both art and design.</p>
    <p>As a pioneer of the Pop Art movement, he turned everyday things like soup cans and famous faces into colorful,</p>
    <p>eye-catching pieces that made people think.</p>
    <p>I love how he used bright colors, repetition, and imagery from mass media to create something entirely new.</p>
    <p>Warhol had a way of mixing commercial and fine art that still feels fresh today,</p>
    <p>and his influence is everywhere from ads to album covers to modern branding.</p>

    <p>Jackson Wang is an absolutely amazing and talented singer. I used to listen to</p> 
    <p>him back when he was still with the K-pop group GOT7, and I’ve admired him ever</p> 
    <p>since. He’s someone who has worked incredibly hard for what he wanted.</p>
    <p>Originally from China, he chose to pursue music in Korea, even though he didn’t</p> 
    <p>know much Korean at the time. Through dedication and effort, he not only became</p> 
    <p>fluent in Korean but also speaks Mandarin, Cantonese, and English.</p>
    <p>Now with a successful solo career, Jackson is loved not just for his music but for 
    <p>his beautiful, respectful, and goofy personality. He also has his own brand and</p> 
    <p>plays an active role in directing his music videos, which I really admire. I simply</p> 
    <p>love the way he expresses himself through his art and music.</p>

    <p>Naoko Takeuchi is the Japanese manga artist best known for creating <em>Sailor Moon</em>, one of the most iconic magical girl series of all time.</p>
    <p>I first watched <em>Sailor Moon</em> when I was around 10 or 11 years old and have loved it ever since. The anime originally aired in the early 1990s,</p>
    <p>and it quickly became a favorite among fans worldwide.</p>
    <p>Naoko Takeuchi is a designer I admire because of how she created a world that was both magical and relatable.</p>
    <p>Her characters were strong, stylish, and had real emotions, which made them feel like friends.</p>
    <p>She blended fantasy with everyday life in a way that was both fun and meaningful.</p>
    <p>Takeuchi's work has inspired countless artists and designers, showing that you can mix beauty with powerful storytelling.</p>
    <p>Her influence can be seen in everything from fashion to animation, making her a true icon in the design world.</p>
    <p>For me, <em>Sailor Moon</em> was fun and it was one of the most memorable romances I watched growing up.</p>
