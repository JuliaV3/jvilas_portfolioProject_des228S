        <h2>- Places That I Want Design To Take ME:</h2>

   <h2>Tokyo</h2>

 <img src="img/tokyo.png" alt="tokyo street" style="width:300px;height:auto;">
 <p>I've always liked Japan. When I visited a year ago, I was completely taken in by the food, the collectibles, the lights, and the energy.</p> 
 <p>Tokyo felt like a more organized version of New York: chaotic yet beautiful, with towering buildings, neon signs, and bold fashion choices.</p> 
 <p>Beyond aesthetics, Japan has a deep cultural appreciation for design, especially in visual communication and product innovation.</p> 
 <p>It’s definitely a place where I’d love to try my luck and grow as a designer.</p>

 <h2>Sydney</h2>

 <img src="img/sydney.png" alt="opera house" style="width:300px;height:auto;">
 <p>I remember watching a segment years ago about how Sydney is known for its advancements in technology and innovation.</p> 
 <p>To be honest, I was more fascinated by the idea of everyday encounters with wild animals.</p> 
 <p>Still, from a professional standpoint, Sydney has a strong focus on visual design and UX, making it a city I’d seriously consider for design work.</p>

 <h2>Seattle</h2>

 <img src="img/seattle.png" alt="city" style="width:300px;height:auto;">
 <p>Seattle stands out for its balance of creativity and tech. With companies like Microsoft, Amazon, and countless startups based there,</p> 
 <p>i's a great environment for designers interested in digital innovation.</p> 
 <p>The city’s appreciation for clean, functional design also makes it an inspiring place to grow professionally.</p>

 <h2>Singapore</h2>

 <img src="img/singapore.png" alt="twin towers" style="width:300px;height:auto;">
 <p>Singapore is one of Southeast Asia’s leading tech and design capitals.</p> 
 <p>It blends precision, innovation, and cultural diversity, making it a fascinating place to work in UX/UI, branding, or motion design.</p> 
 <p>It’s also a visually stunning city — and to be honest, I can’t help but think of “Crazy Rich Asians” every time it comes to mind.</p>

 <h2>New York</h2>

 <img src="img/ny.png" alt="times squere" style="width:300px;height:auto;">
 <p>New York has always felt like the heart of creativity and complete chaos.</p> 
 <p>show “Sex and the City” captures the fast pace of daily life, and the city is bursting with artistic energy</p> 
 <p>from fashion shows and gallery openings to immersive club events.</p> 
 <p>Opportunities span across advertising, digital media, animation, and more.</p> 
 <p>It’s the kind of place that challenges and inspires designers to do their best work, and you need to be your best.</p>
 <p>I’d love to experience New York as a designer, but only once I feel truly confident in my skills.</p>
